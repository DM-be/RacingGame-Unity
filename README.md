# RacingGame-Unity
The Unity project for the racing game developed for the foundation .NET course.

## Description
A Unity racing game was made for the foundation .NET course. The game features a login system that keeps track of a user's score. These scores are kept as "highscores" in a database. These highscores can be viewed on a [frontend](https://github.com/DM-be/RacingGame-frontend) hosted website made in Angular.

## Technical

In this Unity project I built the login and registering screen, the score system (keeping track of time and sending it on each finished race) and other necessary scripts.
In other words I fully integrated it with the [backendproject](https://github.com/DM-be/RacingGame-backend).
